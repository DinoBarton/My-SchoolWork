  <h1>Cool</h1>

  <p>
    Cool is not about following the crowd,
    It's about being true to yourself, proud.
    It's about being unique and bold,
    Standing out from the rest, never old.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cool is not about material things,
    It's about the joy that your heart brings.
    It's about the kindness in your soul,
    Making others feel whole.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cool is not about being perfect,
    It's about embracing your imperfections, erect.
    It's about learning from your mistakes,
    And growing stronger, never at stakes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cool is not about being afraid,
    It's about facing your fears, unafraid.
    It's about standing up for what's right,
    Even when it's a fight.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cool is being you, authentic and true,
    Letting your light shine, bright and new.
    So be cool in your own unique way,
    And the world will see your brilliance, day by day.
