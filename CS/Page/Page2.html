  <h1>Cool</h1>

  <p style='fontsize:160%;'>
    Cool is not about following the crowd,<br>
    It's about being true to yourself, proud.<br>
    It's about being unique and bold,<br>
    Standing out from the rest, never old.<br>
  </p>

  <p style='fontsize:160%;'>
    Cool is not about material things,<br>
    It's about the joy that your heart brings.<br>
    It's about the kindness in your soul,<br>
    Making others feel whole.<br>
  </p>

  <p style='fontsize:160%;'>
    Cool is not about being perfect,<br>
    It's about embracing your imperfections, erect.<br>
    It's about learning from your mistakes,<br>
    And growing stronger, never at stakes.<br>
  </p>

  <p style='fontsize:160%;'>
    Cool is not about being afraid,<br>
    It's about facing your fears, unafraid.<br>
    It's about standing up for what's right,<br>
    Even when it's a fight.<br>
  </p>

  <p style='fontsize:160%;'>
    Cool is being you, authentic and true,<br>
    Letting your light shine, bright and new.<br>
    So be cool in your own unique way,<br>
    And the world will see your brilliance, day by day.<br>
  </p>
