        In a world where trends come and go,
        Being cool is the way to glow.
        It's not about fitting some mold,
        But standing out, being bold.
		<br>
		<br>
        Cool is a breeze on a summer's day,
        A rhythm that makes your heart sway.
        It's the confidence in your stride,
        A sense of self you don't hide.
		<br>
		<br>
        Cool is a smile that lights the room,
        Chasing away any hint of gloom.
        It's the kindness in your heart,
        A work of art, a living part.
		<br>
		<br>
        Cool is the way you treat others right,
        Lifting them up with all your might.
        It's the wisdom in your words,
        A symphony that's often heard.
		<br>
		<br>
        Cool is the courage to be yourself,
        Embracing individuality, not someone else.
        It's the passion that drives your soul,
        A unique, ever-evolving role.
		<br>
		<br>
        So be cool in your own unique way,
        Let your colors shine, come what may.
        In this world of endless streams,
        Cool is being true to your dreams.
