## GitHub and Why I'm Using It 💡 <a name="github-and-why"></a>
GitHub is a platform that allows me to share my project with you easily. Here's why I chose to use it:

- **Collaboration:** GitHub enables me to work on my project from anywhere and even collaborate with others if needed.
- **Transparency:** You can see all the changes and progress I've made throughout the project's development.
- **Version Control:** GitHub tracks changes, so I can always go back to a previous version if necessary.
- **Showcasing Skills:** Using GitHub helps me develop valuable skills in version control and collaboration, which are relevant in the modern world.
